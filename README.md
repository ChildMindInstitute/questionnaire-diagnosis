# Notebooks on data from the Child Mind Institute

##  Versioning with Jupyter

The following conventions hold:

1. Only notebooks with cleared output are committed.
2. Other notebooks should contain the string `WIP` and are thus ignored by `git`.
3. Notebooks that mark a meeting or other kind of checkpoint should contain a string string with date that must include a year. Those are also ignored by `git`.
4. Older notebooks (for completeness) can be dumped into the directory `old-notebooks` which is also ignored by `git`.
5. `git` also ignores the resources directory because it contains proprietary questionnaire information and private data sets.
