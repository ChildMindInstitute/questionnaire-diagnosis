For a standard database table, such as `hbnq_t`, each column is associated with a [data type](https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html), which in sqlite3 are `TEXT`, `REAL`, `INTEGER`, and `BLOB`. For a BayesDB population, each variable is associated with a _statistical data type_. These statistical types, such as `NOMINAL`, `NUMERICAL`, `MAGNITUDE`, and `COUNTS`, specify the set of values and default probability distributions used for building probabilistic models of the data in the population. In this tutorial, we will use the `NUMERICAL` and `NOMINAL` statistical data types."

    "Now that we have created the `gapminder` population, the next step is to analyze the data by building probabilistic models which explain the data generating process. Probabilistic data analyses in BayesDB are specified using an `ANALYSIS SCHEMA`. The default model discovery engine in BayesDB is Cross-Categorization [(Crosscat)](http://jmlr.org/papers/v17/11-392.html). CrossCat is a Bayesian factorial mixture model which learns a full joint distribution over all variables in the population, using a divide-and-conquer approach. We will explore CrossCat more in this notebook.\n",

    "For now we use MML to declare the an analysis schema named `hbnq_crosscat` for the `hbnq` population. Note that that we have left the schema in `crosscat()` empty, which will apply the built-in defaults. Specifying custom analysis schemas is the subject of another tutorial."

    "Bonferroni correction for multiple testing would perhaps render the p-values of these correlations as statistically insignificant. However, Bonferroni is also highly conservative, and will cause many common-sense relationships to be insigificant as well under linear correlation. These design trade-offs are very common in drawing inferences from frequentist methods such Pearson R."

Recall from the visualizations of CrossCat that, within each _view_ of dependent variables, CrossCat learns a clustering of the countries. These country clusterings will typically differ based on the view. Also recall that different CrossCat analyses in the ensemble (we have 32 in total) will find different clusterings for both variables and rows, which we aggregate over using BQL queries."
