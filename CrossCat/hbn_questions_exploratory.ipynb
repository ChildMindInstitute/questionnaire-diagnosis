We will keep the `Name` column, since it is the identifier for each record. The `--seed` flag specifies the random seed to create the subsample, which will ensure our analyses are reproducible. Finally, `hbnq_t` is the original table, `hbnq_t_subsample` is the name of the new table, and 100 is the number of columns to downsample to."

For a BayesDB population, each variable is associated with a _statistical data type_. These statistical types, such as `NOMINAL`, `NUMERICAL`, `MAGNITUDE`, and `COUNTS`, specify the set of values and default probability distributions used for building probabilistic models of the data in the population. In this tutorial, we will use the `NUMERICAL` and `NOMINAL` statistical data types."

Probabilistic data analyses in BayesDB are specified using an `ANALYSIS SCHEMA`. The default model discovery engine in BayesDB is Cross-Categorization [(Crosscat)](http://jmlr.org/papers/v17/11-392.html). CrossCat is a Bayesian factorial mixture model which learns a full joint distribution over all variables in the population, using a divide-and-conquer approach. We will explore CrossCat more in this notebook.\n",
